(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

    (* 
    
    Q: What are the types of functions foo and bar?

    A: foo has the type int -> string
       bar has the type int list -> string list 


    Q: What does the function bar do.
       Focus on what it does rather than how it does it.

    A: foo takes an integer and returns it's binary string representation
       bar takes a list of integers and returns a list of the binary string representations.
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo and bar?

    A: foo: convertToBinary
       bar: convertListToBinary 
        
    Q: The function foo does not return reasonable results for all possible inputs.
       What requirements must we have on the input to foo in order to get reasonable results?
    
    A: The input must be non-negative.

    let bar2 _ = failwith "not implemented"

(* Question 2.4 *)

    (*

    Q: Neither foo nor bar is tail recursive. Pick one (not both) of them and explain why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation.
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function is not tail recursive.
       Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must evaluate to the same value
       ((5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27, for instance).

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    
    Q: Even though neither `foo` nor `bar` is tail recursive only one of them runs the risk of overflowing the stack.
       Which one and why does  the other one not risk overflowing the stack?
